Hi,

I have included a mix of functional and class based components purely
to showcase both areas. I have also left the architecture the same - 
if this were commercial software, i would ofcourse refractor it.
Only included 2 tests, but i think you get 'jest' of it.

Thankyou for taking the time to review my code.
